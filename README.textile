h1. Welcome

h3. Welcome to the *new* home of **Scribe**

h1. Why use Scribe?

h3. Dead Simple

Who said OAuth was difficult? Configuring scribe is so easy your grandma can do it! check it out:

OAuthService service = new ServiceBuilder()
                                  .provider(LinkedInApi.class)
                                  .apiKey(YOUR_API_KEY)
                                  .apiSecret(YOUR_API_SECRET)
                                  .build();
                                  
That **single line** (added newlines for readability) is the only thing you need to configure scribe with LinkedIn's OAuth API for example.

h3. Threadsafe

Hit Scribe as hard and with many threads as you like.

h3. Supports all major OAuth APIs out-of-the-box

h3. Small and modular

Scribe's code is small (about 1k LOC) and simple to understand. No smart-ass or "clever" hacks here.

h3. Stable & bulletproof

Test coverage of about x% to keep you safe from harm. 

When something bad actually happens, Scribe's meaningful error messages will tell you exactly what went wrong, when and where.
